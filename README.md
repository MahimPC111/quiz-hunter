####Project description: 
At first I installed React App in my drive(C:). Then I set this project's name as "Quiz Hunter". After then I installed React bootstrap, React font awesome, React router dom and many others. I divided the whole project into small parts as components and started to work on it so that it makes easier for me to work properly in this project. So, I started working on components one by one and also made them Mobile view and Tab view responsive. I tried to keep all the code fresh. I did one more thing while doing this project. I added, committed and pushed this project in my Private Github repository after finishing small tasks of each components. Overall I can say, I tried my best to complete this project.
